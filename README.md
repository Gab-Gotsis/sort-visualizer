A simple sorting algorithm visualiser that takes in an inputed sorting algorithm like bubble sort, and displays it visually. Was created as a weekend project as I became more familiar with Pygame. Currently the algorithm inputed is hardcoded, however I plan to allow the user to select an algorithms in the future. To run, simply run sortingalg.py
