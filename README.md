A simple sorting algorithm visualiser that takes in a sorting algorithm like bubble sort as input, and displays it visually. Was created as a weekend project as I became more familiar with Pygame. Currently, the algorithm is hardcoded, however, I plan to allow the user to select the algorithm used in the future. To run, simply run sortingalg.py.
