# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
A simple sorting algorithm visualiser that takes in a sorting algorithm like bubble sort as input, and displays it visually. Was created as a weekend project as I became more familiar with Pygame. Currently, the algorithm is hardcoded, however, there are plans to allow the user to select the algorithm used.

# Instructions
Run 
```
python3 .\sortingalg.py
```
